Photoactivation Paper
---------------------

This is a repository of analysis code for a paper in preparation. The
repository includes:

* Jupyter notebooks that perform all of the analysis, from the raw data to the
  published figure
* a Python file containing some functions shared by the notebooks
* an ``environment.yml`` file that specifies that exact versions of all
  Python packages used in the analysis
* other [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Examples) files containing
  experiment metadata

It does not contain the large data files. These should be downloaded separately
and placed in the `data` directory.
